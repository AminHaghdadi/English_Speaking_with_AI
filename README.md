I have developed an intelligent conversational agent that acts as an English teacher to help improve your speaking skills. The application allows users to have a natural dialogue where they can speak freely, and receive feedback on their grammar, vocabulary, and overall speaking ability.

The core technology leverages OpenAI's powerful language models Whisper and ChatGPT, paired with the Bark text-to-speech engine. Users simply record an audio clip of themselves speaking, and Whisper transcribes it into text. This text is then analyzed by ChatGPT, which identifies grammatical errors, uncommon word usage, and other issues. ChatGPT also continues the conversation by responding on the topic and asking interesting questions to keep the dialogue engaging.

Finally, the feedback and extended conversation generated by ChatGPT is synthesized into natural sounding speech using Bark. This allows users to hear their mistakes corrected clearly, and have a back-and-forth discussion to practice their conversational English. The combination of OpenAI for language processing and Bark for lifelike speech makes for an incredibly useful and realistic virtual teacher.

## Notice

Because this code needs to download the models and also needs a strong GPU, I ran this code in google colab and I uploaded the file in the link below:
